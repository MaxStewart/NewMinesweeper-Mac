This project was our Mac version of a modified minesweeper game that I developed as part of a team in C++ using the SFML library.
To play this game it requires you to setup SFML on XCode and instructions can be found at https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-osx.php
We developed the game on windows (Visual Studio ran a lot better with SFML) and then at the end we ported the project to Mac (hence the small number of commits)
